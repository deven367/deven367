# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Deven

- ðŸ‘€ My interests span a wide range, including philosophy, psychology, physics, reading, and cooking, among many others.
- ðŸ‘€ I began my PhD journey in Fall 2023 at Indiana University Bloomington.
- ðŸŒ± Before starting my PhD, I completed my Master's at the University of Cincinnati, researching semantic dynamics and how sentence encoders capture meaning from text. My thesis on this topic is available [here](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/etd/r/1501/10?clear=10&p10_accession_num=ucin1637311155942699).
- Following my Masterâ€™s, I worked as a Full Stack Machine Learning Engineer at [GQC](https://gqc.com/).
